a(VI don't want to write an autobiography because I would become public property with no privacy left.
p19
VStephen Hawking
p20
tp21
a(VI am absolutely opposed to a national ID card. This is a total contradiction of what a free society is all about. The purpose of government is to protect the secrecy and the privacy of all individuals, not the secrecy of government. We don't need a national ID card.

VRon Paul

a(VI believe in a zone of privacy.
p28
VHillary Clinton

a(VI do get recognized, but I must say Edinburgh is a fantastic city to live if you're well-known. There is an innate respect for privacy in Edinburgh people, and I also think they're used to seeing me walking around, so I don't think I'm a very big deal.

p55
VCharles Caleb Colton
p56
tp57
a(VThen I realized that secrecy is actually to the detriment of my own peace of mind and self, and that I could still sustain my belief in privacy and be authentic and transparent at the same time. It was a pretty revelatory moment, and there's been a liberating force that's come from it.
p58
VAlanis Morissette

p61
VBill Maher
p62
tp63
a(VFortunately, we have help from the media. I have to say this: I'm very grateful for the support and kindness that we've gotten. People have respected their privacy and in that way, I think, you know, no matter what people may feel about my husband's policies or what have you, they care about children and that's been good to see.
p64
VMichelle Obama
p65
tp66
a(VYou know, you can make a small mistake in language or etiquette in Britain, or you could when I was younger, and really be made to feel it, and it's the flick of a lash, but it would sting, and especially at school where there's not much privacy, and so on. You could, yes, undoubtedly be made to feel crushed.
p67
VChristopher Hitchens

p199
VHerbert Hoover
p200
tp201
a(VI have been called a nun with a switchblade where my privacy is concerned. I think there's a point where one says, that's for family, that's for me.
p202
VJulie Andrews
p203
tp204
a(VI'm not that ambitious any more. I just like my privacy. I wish I really wasn't talked about at all.
p205

p211
VLisa Bonet
p212
tp213
a(VI'm not a kid. You don't get in this business for anonymity. It's not like I have posters of myself on the wall, but at the same time, I'm kind of ready for a little bit of it, but I worry for my little one, and my family - their privacy. That's what I'm more protective of.
p214
VHugh Jackman
p215
tp216
a(VWithout whining and without making myself a tragic figure, there is no replacement for the loss of your privacy. It's a huge sacrifice.

p223
VMargaret Cho
p224
tp225
a(VI'm a very private person. I like staying home and doing my stuff. I hate people invading on my privacy. I hate talking about my private life.
p226
VGisele Bundchen
p227
tp228
a(VThe issue is privacy. Why is the decision by a woman to sleep with a man she has just met in a bar a private one, and the decision to sleep with the same man for $100 subject to criminal penalties?
p229
VAnna Quindlen
p230
tp231
a(VIt's hard to just kinda get some privacy and do your own thing.
p232
VShaun White
p233
tp234
a(VI don't always want my opinion known. What little privacy I have left I'd like to maintain.
p235
VCalvin Klein
p236
tp237
a(VIf people are constantly reading about you, and you're overexposed, they've got no reason to go see your movies. Also, it's not pleasant or nice to have your privacy invaded.
p238
VJohn Cusack
p239
tp240
a(VAny privacy in public is a hard thing to negotiate.
p241
VBenedict Cumberbatch
p242
tp243
a(VThe people who are worried about privacy have a legitimate worry. But we live in a complex world where you're going to have to have a level of security greater than you did back in the olden days, if you will. And our laws and our interpretation of the Constitution, I think, have to change.
p244
VMichael Bloomberg
p245
tp246
a(VI want my government to do something about my privacy - I don't want to just do it on my own.
p247
VEvgeny Morozov
p248
tp249
a(VReally, life is complicated enough without having a bunch of Senators deciding what we should do in the privacy of our own homes.
p250
VBarbara Boxer
p251
tp252
a(VThere is nothing new in the realization that the Constitution sometimes insulates the criminality of a few in order to protect the privacy of us all.
p253
VAntonin Scalia
p254
tp255
a(VI've always retained my privacy, but now I protect it even more.
p256
VDaniel Craig
p257
tp258
a(VI'm learning to accept the lack of privacy as the real downer in my profession.
p259
VHalle Berry
p260
tp261
a(VI enjoyed having a reputation as being wild, but these days I try not to worry about what people think in the privacy of their own brain or what they write in the bizarre publicity of their own newspapers, because all of those things are meaningless.
p262
VRussell Brand
p263
tp264
a(VFrom the moment I walked into the White House, it was as if I had no privacy at all.
p265
VNancy Reagan
p266
tp267
a(VI am of mixed minds about the issue of privacy. On one hand, I understand that information is power, and power is, well, power, so keeping your private information to yourself is essential - especially if you are a controversial figure, a celebrity, or a dissident.
p268
VSusan Orlean
p269
tp270
a(VAll the legal action I've taken against newspapers has had a massively positive effect on my life and achieved exactly what I wanted, which is privacy and non-harassment.
p271
VSienna Miller
p272
tp273
a(VAlthough I am a public figure, I'm still a little shy. I don't think my own personality is important. I prefer to keep some small dosage of privacy.
p274
VJoshua Lederberg
p275
tp276
a(VPrivacy about giving is counterproductive. There is solid scientific research showing that people are more likely to give if they can see that others are giving. The richest people, in particular, should be setting an example.
p277
VPeter Singer
p278
tp279
a(VI like texting as much as the next kidult - and embrace it as yet more evidence, along with email, that we live now in the post-aural age, when an unsolicited phone call is, thankfully, becoming more and more understood to be an unspeakable social solecism, tantamount to an impertinent invasion of privacy.
p280
VWill Self
p281
tp282
a(VPeople aren't interested in others controlling what they can do or read or see in the privacy of their own homes.
p283
VLarry Flynt
p284
tp285
a(VHow many of you have broken no laws this month? That's the kind of society I want to build. I want a guarantee - with physics and mathematics, not with laws - that we can give ourselves real privacy of personal communications.
p286
VJohn Gilmore
p287
tp288
a(VWe need to start seeing privacy as a commons - as some kind of a public good that can get depleted as too many people treat it carelessly or abandon it too eagerly. What is privacy for? This question needs an urgent answer.
p289
VEvgeny Morozov
p290
tp291
a(VThe bigger the network, the harder it is to leave. Many users find it too daunting to start afresh on a new site, so they quietly consent to Facebook's privacy bullying.
p292
VEvgeny Morozov
p293
tp294
a(VYou already have zero privacy - get over it.
p295
VScott McNealy
p296
tp297
a(VPrivacy is big for me. To do interviews even, I have a very love/hate with it.
p298
VZach Galifianakis
p299
tp300
a(VWe've come to expect so little from online privacy measures that public displays of concern about the matter are more or less for show. Being devastated to discover you've been tagged in somebody else's photo has an air of the melodramatic about it at this point.
p301
VSloane Crosley
p302
tp303
a(VOh, well, there's a difference between privacy and secrecy.
p304
VLaura Schlessinger
p305
tp306
a(VOne of the great penalties those of us who live our lives in full view of the public must pay is the loss of that most cherished birthright of man's, privacy.
p307
VMary Pickford
p308
tp309
a(VI respect someone's right to privacy and I want them to know it.
p310
VTerry Gross
p311
tp312
a(VFacebook says, 'Privacy is theft,' because they're selling your lack of privacy to the advertisers who might show up one day.

p314
tp315
a(VThe emphasis must be not on the right to abortion but on the right to privacy and reproductive control.
p316
VRuth Bader Ginsburg
p317
tp318
a(VWhen it comes to privacy and accountability, people always demand the former for themselves and the latter for everyone else.
p319
VDavid Brin
p320
tp321
a(VI value my privacy and my personal life - and I certainly don't exploit my personal life.
p322
VScarlett Johansson
p323
tp324
a(VYou have to make a lot of sacrifices, and the main thing you have to sacrifice is your privacy. It's funny because when I was growing up, my daddy was and still is an insurance agent in our home town. He couldn't go anywhere without somebody recognizing him or needing something from him.
p325
VJosh Turner
p326
tp327
a(VEven though now I'm pretty popular in my country and tennis is the No. 1 sport, and I'm very flattered that the people recognise me and come up and give me compliments, I'm more a person who likes to have privacy and peace.
p328
VNovak Djokovic
p329
tp330
a(VI don't mind gearing my life towards privacy. It's my nature.
p331
VJohn Travolta
p332
tp333
a(VIt's the interviewee's job to know that his privacy is going to be invaded on some level. Otherwise, you are better off not doing the interview.
p334
VJohn Travolta
p335
tp336
a(VI was suited for fame, and I mean that in the most non-egocentric way. I don't mind gearing my life towards privacy. It's my nature.
p337
VJohn Travolta
p338
tp339
a(VIssues such as transparency often boil down to which side of - pick a number - 40 you're on. Under 40, and transparency is generally considered a good thing for society. Over 40, and one generally chooses privacy over transparency. On every side of this issue, hypocrisy abounds.
p340
VGraydon Carter
p341
tp342
a(VLaw-abiding citizens value privacy. Terrorists require invisibility. The two are not the same, and they should not be confused.
p343
VRichard Perle
p344
tp345
a(VThe companies that do the best job on managing a user's privacy will be the companies that ultimately are the most successful.
p346
VFred Wilson
p347
tp348
a(VI want my son - and my kids, if I have more - to grow up in a way that is as anonymous as possible. The fact that his father and I have chosen to do the work that we do doesn't give anybody the right to invade our privacy.
p349
VPenelope Cruz
p350
tp351
a(VI feel like everyone has the right to privacy, even if you're the most famous person in the world.
p352
VMarina and the Diamonds
p353
tp354
a(VI can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.
p355
VEdward Snowden
p356
tp357
a(VI never like other people to clean for me. I don't want them to invade my own privacy.
p358
VBess Myerson
p359
tp360
a(VI did not become successful in my work through embracing or engaging in celebrity culture. I never signed away my privacy in exchange for success.
p361
VSteve Coogan
p362
tp363
a(VI think Democrats are right. We fight for the American dream, for the environment, for privacy rights, a woman's right to choose, a good public education system.
p364
VBarbara Boxer
p365
tp366
a(VNo one can train you to be famous. How do you deal with the loss of anonymity, the loss of privacy? You have to be disciplined.
p367
VWesley Snipes
p368
tp369
a(VI don't think I responded very well to the sudden celebrity, the sudden fame, and the loss of privacy.
p370
VDavid Schwimmer
p371
tp372
a(VYou know, we're very private, and I think that we really separate and try to keep our privacy to ourselves. There's things that people assume a lot of times, and we understand that people are interested, but we really try to keep our family life private as much as we can.
p373
VTim McGraw
p374
tp375
a(VBut the time has come for journalists to acknowledge that a zone of privacy does exist.
p376
VRoger Mudd
p377
tp378
a(VEvery American deserves to live in freedom, to have his or her privacy respected and a chance to go as far as their ability and effort will take them - regardless of race, gender, ethnicity or economic circumstances.
p379
VChristopher Dodd
p380
tp381
a(VAs a social good, I think privacy is greatly overrated because privacy basically means concealment. People conceal things in order to fool other people about them. They want to appear healthier than they are, smarter, more honest and so forth.
p382
VRichard Posner
p383
tp384
a(VI have a very good sense of tone, and it's possible to talk about very personal things and maintain a level of dignity and even privacy - to go to the place, to talk about it, but not get icky.
p385
VJane Pauley
p386
tp387
a(VI can't understand why anyone would want to live the life of a politician if you can't say pretty much what you think. You are not in it for the money: there's unremitting pressure on your life, you give up so much of your privacy. It can only be because of the things you want to do and the things you want to say.
p388
VKenneth Robert Livingstone
p389
tp390
a(VIsn't privacy about keeping taboos in their place?
p391
VKate Millett
p392
tp393
a(VI've been careful to keep my life separate because it's important to me to have privacy and for my life not to be a marketing device for a movie or a TV show. I'm worth more than that.
p394
VLisa Kudrow
p395
tp396
a(VI enjoy privacy. I think it's nice to have a little mystery. I think because of technology a lot of the mystery is gone in life, and I'd like to preserve some of that.
p397
VMaggie Q
